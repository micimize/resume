For this project, I built much of the data-related infrastructure for the [Air Quality Data Commons](https://aqdatacommons.org/). This included:

- **A generalized air quality data pipeline**, capable of ingesting a wide swath of air quality data formats  
  This included a highly flexible normalization and validation modules, orchestration and ETL modules, and various internal tools for managing air quality data projects and [table schemas](https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/table-schema/).
- **A superset resource and [dashboard](https://aqdatacommons.org/superset/dashboard/bay_area_mobile_analysis/) generator** for exposing and visualizing secure bigquery resources automatically.
- Developing APIs for managing and [exploring](https://aqdatacommons.org/explore) data projects
- Managing Google Cloud infrastructure and deployments

<details> <summary>As well as a large amounts of high quality technical writing</summary>

This included highly detailed documentation, roadmaps, architecture proposals, expositional issues, and user guides.
This helped communicate the development process to the less-technical stakeholders, ensure the project's future maintainability.

While these things are important in any project, they were particularly important here:

- as I was the both the sole developer of much of the AQDC, and a contractor
- The AQDC is designed to be an open platform, with a high degree of less-technical usage surface area
- It is slated to be [opened sourced](https://aqdatacommons.org/faqs/software) in the future
