`major_graphql` uses the dart `build` system and `gql` to generate `built_value` classes, primarily for use in client side applications. It is the successor to [`graphql-to-dart`], and also resulted in a [type modeling PR to `gql`]. It is still experimental.

 I'll highlight my [Optimistic Cache Updates PR](https://github.com/zino-app/graphql-flutter/pull/199), as a decent sample of my technical communication, as well as [the v4 release](https://github.com/zino-app/graphql
