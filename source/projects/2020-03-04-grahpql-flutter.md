A `graphql` client for the dart lanugage and flutter, to which I am one of the top [contributors](https://github.com/zino-app/graphql-flutter/graphs/contributors).
I'll highlight my [Optimistic Cache Updates PR](https://github.com/zino-app/graphql-flutter/pull/199), as a decent sample of my technical communication

I have have also created a few related projects, such as the [`graphql-to-dart`](https://github.com/micimize/graphql-to-dart/) code generator, and it's in-development rewrite [built-graphql](https://github.com/micimize/built-graphql)
