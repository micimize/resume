I completed [the Andrew Ng Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) with a 95.7%. I've also watched the [Ludobods Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAuiGdPEdw0jySMqCxj2-BQ5QKM9ts8ik) on Evolutionary Robotics, as well the [Oxford DeepNLP lectures](https://github.com/oxford-cs-deepnlp-2017/lectures).
