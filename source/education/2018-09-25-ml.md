I completed [the Andrew Ng Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) with a 95.7%. I've also watched all of the [Ludobods Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAuiGdPEdw0jySMqCxj2-BQ5QKM9ts8ik) on Evolutionary Robotics, all of [Oxford DeepNLP lectures](https://github.com/oxford-cs-deepnlp-2017/lectures), and continue to regularly research the subject. Unfortunately the only actual code I have to show for this research is [live-neat](#neat)
