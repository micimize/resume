This included highly detailed documentation, roadmaps, architecture proposals, expositional issues, and user guides.

While always valuable for communicating the development process to less-technical stakeholders and future maintainers,

- The AQDC is designed to be an open platform, with a large surface area of moderately-technical usage
- It is slated to be [opened sourced](https://aqdatacommons.org/faqs/software) in the future
