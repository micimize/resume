As a contractor, I usually wear multiple hats, often managing AWS deployments, writing server and frontend logic, and integrating external services for the client as needed. Some specific solutions include:

- An interactive ETL pipeline builder written in Clojure
- Dockerized python microservices deployed to AWS
- A [peerassets crypto wallet](https://peerassets.github.io/chizukeki/) built with react-native

As well as a number of web applications built with Python and/or Javascript.
